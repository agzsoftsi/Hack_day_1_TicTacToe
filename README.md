# Rule

Each player must only place their symbol once per turn and must not be on a square already played. In case the player cheats, the winner will be the other. A straight or diagonal line must be made per symbol. If the player marks a square, even if it is the smallest mark, he must put the symbol of the next move in that square. Horizontal, vertical and diagonal movements can be performed.
